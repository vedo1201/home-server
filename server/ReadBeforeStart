Repository is not finished, use it on your own risk!

This repo can be used as guide, either for complete beginner or user who is looking to improve their server.
In this guide, firstly, I've covrered some things that are must when we talk about stable, secure and reliable home server.

The things that I have covered are:

  1. Basic things to do after installing ubuntu server, setting it as a good base for future work
  2. Formatting disks, putting a filesystem on them and mounting them in a folder so they are accessible automatticaly on startup
  3. Installing docker for containers
  4. Installing portainer (docker container) for graphical managment of docker containers
  5. Setting up the SAMBA (file sharing system), so that disks in server can be accessed over network through the windows file explorer (This makes files easier to move, copy and manage.
      This is especially helpful for creating backup of docker containers, we will talk about that a little bit later.)
  6.
